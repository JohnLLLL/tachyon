It should be possible to display multiple windows at a time. That is, subdivide the main terminal into an arbitrary arrangement of rectangular subwindows. This includes vertical and horizontal splits.

Normally horizontal splits are expensive to emulate, but it shouldn't be that bad with the client running on the local display.
