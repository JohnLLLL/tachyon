The discussion at http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/137kd9/18_months_ago_termkit_a_nextgeneration_terminal/ has a number of interesting thoughts on ways to improve the capability of terminals. Since tachyon is going to be a terminal emulator of sorts it should do what it can to implement the best of them.

This bug is created with the intent of going through that discussion and creating new bugs for the useful feature suggestions which came out of that discussion.
