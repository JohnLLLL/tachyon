Title: Test harness stops processing data after burst
Type: Bug
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Something is wrong with the test framework such that it stops reading and processing data from the process after the process has pushed a large amount of data in.

This is most obvious in the test escapeCursorDown_pastMargin_withScrollBack where there are hacks to get that test to pass most of the time, but notably not without debug mode on.

Probably some buffer is getting full and then things are getting gummed up. Sometimes writing again later fixes things.
