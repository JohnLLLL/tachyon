As noted at https://github.com/keithw/mosh/issues/2#issuecomment-7925433 there are various sorts of links that someone may be using. We won't do connection persistence but will do the other four quadrants of the latency-bandwidth spectrum.

As such it should be possible to disable automatic transfer skipping for the high latency high bandwidth case.
