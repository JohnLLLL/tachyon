As described in http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/137kd9/18_months_ago_termkit_a_nextgeneration_terminal/c71kkpm one big issue today is that nobody actually uses TERM correctly because everything is too broken when you change it. An alternative would be to have a new escape code which queries various terminal capabilities.

It might work with a canonical list of capabilities indexed. Then the client could send the query code for any capability it wanted to know about. A standard response to an unknown capability would be, say, zero. It is assumed and would be documented, that the client would understand what the valid results are.
