Title: Receive signal to recreate sockets
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000

One major problem with screen multiplexors is that they have to keep a socket file around in order to work. Most of the time this works fine, but there are cases (such as /tmp and a periodic file deleter) where these socket files get deleted. tmux will recreate these sockets when it receives a signal and screen will do the same. Tachyon should support this as well.
