Title: Immediate exit with 'I/O Possible' on Linux over ssh
Type: Bug
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Sometimes when starting Tachyon on a Linux machine it will terminate immediately, before all the initialization is complete, with the message "I/O Possible". This is coming from the default action of SIGIO on Linux which is to terminate the process. If I catch these signals they happen continuously.

It doesn't happen every time I start Tachyon, but seems to happen consistently if I start Tachyon from bash as sh from inside a fresh screen window.
