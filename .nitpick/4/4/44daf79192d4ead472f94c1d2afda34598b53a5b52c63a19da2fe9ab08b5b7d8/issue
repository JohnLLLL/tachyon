Title: Proper shell command argument splitting
Type: Feature
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
Currently Tachyon does simple whitespace tokenization of the shell command arguments. This works much of the time, but is broken if quoting is used to combine space separated words into a single argument or if any escaping is used. This should be fixed to take these complications into account.
