Title: Meta-sequence skipping memmove test seems off
Type: Bug
Units_of_Work: 1000
--
The logic which determines if the memmove to eliminate the meta-sequence characters seems off. It seems to work fine in the single character case of a real live terminal, but I fear that it will fail in an ssh environment where network effects could cause a long input string to arrive at once. The logic must be confirmed and tested in such an environment.
