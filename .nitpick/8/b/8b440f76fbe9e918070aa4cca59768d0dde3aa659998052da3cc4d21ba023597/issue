Title: utf8 support

Currently Tachyon only supports ASCII because each cell is assumed to be a single byte long and any input character is assumed to be a single byte long. Just ASCII isn't really acceptable these days so utf8 should be supported.

The biggest wrinkle with this is that it must be watched to stick a single unicode grapheme cluster into a single cell. Doing this space efficiently might be a bit of a challenge since a grapheme cluster can pretty much be arbitrarily long.
